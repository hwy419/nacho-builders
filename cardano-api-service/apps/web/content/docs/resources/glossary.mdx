Quick reference for terminology you'll encounter when working with Cardano and Nacho API.

## A

### ADA

The native cryptocurrency of Cardano. 1 ADA = 1,000,000 lovelace.

### Address

A Cardano address is a string that identifies where ADA and tokens can be sent. Mainnet addresses start with `addr1`, testnet addresses start with `addr_test1`.

**Example:** `addr1qy2kp7ux2qx7g9h6m8rv4dpuqwfcv2t4a8h5yfjhgpvqc8u5m4c8v3q2z8y7w6v5x4c3b2n1m0k9j8h7g6f5d4s3a2p1q0r`

### API Key

A unique identifier used to authenticate your requests to Nacho API. Keep it secret like a password.

## B

### Bech32

The human-readable address format used in Cardano. More user-friendly than raw hex addresses.

### Block

A collection of transactions grouped together and added to the blockchain. New blocks are created approximately every 20 seconds.

### Block Height

The number of blocks from the genesis block to the current block. Used to identify a specific point in the blockchain's history.

### Block Producer

A stake pool selected to create a new block. Selection is based on stake delegation.

## C

### CBOR

Concise Binary Object Representation. The binary format used to serialize Cardano transactions.

### Chain Sync

A protocol for synchronizing with the blockchain in real-time, receiving new blocks as they're produced.

### Collateral

ADA locked to guarantee a Plutus script won't fail during execution. Required for smart contract transactions.

### Credit

A unit of API usage on Nacho API. Different operations consume different amounts of credits.

## D

### Datum

Data attached to a UTxO that can be read by Plutus scripts. Used to store state in smart contracts.

### Delegation

The process of assigning your staking rights to a stake pool. You keep your ADA but the pool uses your stake to produce blocks.

## E

### Epoch

A 5-day period (432,000 slots) in Cardano. Staking rewards are calculated and distributed per epoch.

### Extended UTxO (EUTxO)

Cardano's enhanced UTxO model that supports smart contracts. UTxOs can include scripts and data, not just values.

## F

### Fee

The cost paid to process a transaction. Calculated based on transaction size and script execution.

**Formula:** `fee = minFeeA × txSize + minFeeB + scriptExecutionCost`

## G

### Genesis Block

The first block of the blockchain, created at network launch.

### GraphQL

A query language for APIs. Nacho API offers GraphQL access to indexed blockchain data via DB-Sync.

## J

### JSON-RPC

The protocol used by Nacho API (via Ogmios). Requests and responses are JSON objects with specific structure:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "queryNetwork/tip",
  "id": 1
}
```

## L

### Lovelace

The smallest unit of ADA. 1 ADA = 1,000,000 lovelace. Named after Ada Lovelace.

### Ledger State

The current state of the blockchain, including all UTxOs, stake distribution, and protocol parameters.

## M

### Mainnet

The production Cardano network where ADA has real value.

### Metadata

Arbitrary data attached to transactions. Can be used for timestamps, messages, or application data.

### Minting

Creating new tokens on Cardano. Requires a minting policy (script).

## N

### Native Token

Tokens created on Cardano without smart contracts. They exist alongside ADA in UTxOs.

### Network ID

Identifier for the Cardano network: 1 for mainnet, 0 for testnets.

## O

### Ogmios

A lightweight bridge between Cardano and JSON-RPC. Nacho API is Ogmios-compatible.

### Output Reference

A unique identifier for a UTxO, consisting of transaction hash + output index.

**Example:** `{ "txHash": "abc123...", "outputIndex": 0 }`

## P

### Plutus

Cardano's smart contract platform. Scripts are written in Plutus (based on Haskell) and compiled to Plutus Core.

### Policy ID

A hash identifying a minting policy. Combined with asset name, uniquely identifies a token.

**Example:** `476039a0949cf0b22f6a800f56780184c44533887ca6e821007840c3`

### Preprod

Pre-production testnet. The recommended network for testing before mainnet deployment.

### Protocol Parameters

Network configuration values that govern fees, sizes, and other blockchain behavior. Updated through governance.

## R

### Redeemer

Data passed to a Plutus script when spending a UTxO. Contains context for script execution.

### Reward Address

A special address that receives staking rewards. Starts with `stake1` on mainnet.

### Rollback

When the blockchain reorganizes, removing recent blocks. Your code should handle rollbacks gracefully.

## S

### Script

Executable code on Cardano. Can be a minting policy, spending validator, or staking script.

### Slot

The smallest time unit in Cardano (1 second). Blocks are produced in slots.

### Stake Pool

An entity that produces blocks on behalf of delegators. Pool operators run the infrastructure.

### Staking

The process of participating in consensus by delegating ADA to a pool. Earn rewards without locking funds.

## T

### Tip

The most recent block on the blockchain. Used to determine "current" state.

### Transaction (Tx)

A state transition on the blockchain. Consumes UTxOs and produces new UTxOs.

### TTL (Time-To-Live)

The slot after which a transaction is invalid. Prevents old transactions from being submitted.

## U

### UTxO (Unspent Transaction Output)

An output from a previous transaction that hasn't been spent. Like a digital bill you can spend.

**Analogy:** If ADA were physical cash, UTxOs would be individual bills in your wallet. To spend, you hand over bills and receive change.

## V

### Value

The assets contained in a UTxO: ADA amount plus any native tokens.

**Example:**
```json
{
  "ada": { "lovelace": 5000000 },
  "assets": {
    "policyId123": {
      "tokenName": 100
    }
  }
}
```

## W

### Wallet

Software that manages your keys and builds transactions. Can be browser-based (Nami, Eternl) or hardware (Ledger, Trezor).

### WebSocket

A protocol for persistent, bidirectional communication. Used for chain sync and real-time updates.

### Witness

Proof that a transaction is authorized, typically a signature from the required keys.
